# versioned-object [Deprecated]
Library for handling and creating versioned objects and IRIs for use with the Bravo API

Because of practical problems in actual use, we are switching to a similar, but syntactically different concept and this repo is therefore archived. 
See [https://github.com/equinor/records](https://github.com/equinor/records)

The library consists of three parts that can to some extent be used separately:

* [IRIReference](/VersionedObject/docs/irireference.md).
* [Edge Reifier](/VersionedObject/docs/edgereifier.md).
* [Graph Comparer](/VersionedObject/docs/graphcomparer.md).
