# versioned-object
Library for handling and creating versioned objects and IRIs for use with the Bravo API

Because of practical problems in actual use, we are switching to a similar, but syntactically different concept and this repo is therefore archived. 

The library consists of three parts that can to some extent be used separately:

* [IRIReference /VersionedObject/docs/irireference.md](/VersionedObject/docs/irireference.md).
* [Edge Reifier /VersionedObject/docs/edgereifier.md](/VersionedObject/docs/edgereifier.md).
* [Graph Comparer /VersionedObject/docs/graphcomparer.md](/VersionedObject/docs/graphcomparer.md).
